# App Review Reply — Guideline 5.1.2 (Privacy - Data Use and Sharing)

## Respuesta para App Store Connect Resolution Center

Hello App Review team,

We have updated the app privacy information in App Store Connect. The app **does NOT track users** across apps or websites for advertising purposes.

### Data Collection Clarification

The data collected by the app is used **exclusively** for:
- **Basic app functionality**: User authentication, profile management, and account access
- **Core features**: RSVPs to events, class attendance management, user-generated content
- **Communication**: Customer support and user notifications
- **Technical diagnostics**: Error logs and performance data for app stability

### The app does NOT:
- ❌ Use advertising identifiers (IDFA)
- ❌ Track users across apps or websites
- ❌ Share data with data brokers
- ❌ Use third-party analytics services for advertising
- ❌ Link collected data with third-party data for advertising

### Privacy Information Update

We have updated the App Privacy section in App Store Connect to reflect that **all collected data categories are marked as "NOT used for tracking"**:
- Other User Content → NOT used for tracking
- Product Interaction → NOT used for tracking
- Other Usage Data → NOT used for tracking
- Other Diagnostic Data → NOT used for tracking
- Email Address → NOT used for tracking
- Name → NOT used for tracking
- Search History → NOT used for tracking
- Customer Support → NOT used for tracking
- Purchase History → NOT used for tracking
- User ID → NOT used for tracking
- Performance Data → NOT used for tracking
- Crash Data → NOT used for tracking
- Other Contact Info → NOT used for tracking

### Conclusion

Since the app does not track users, **App Tracking Transparency (ATT) is not required**. The privacy information in App Store Connect has been updated to accurately reflect this.

Thank you for your review.
