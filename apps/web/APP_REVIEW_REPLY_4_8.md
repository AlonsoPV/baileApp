## App Review Reply — Guideline 4.8 (Login Services)

Hello App Review team,

We revised the app to provide **Sign in with Apple** as an equivalent login option alongside Google.

- **Data minimization**: Sign in with Apple provides only the user’s **name and email address** (as allowed by the user and Apple).
- **Private email**: users can choose **“Hide My Email”** during account creation/sign‑in, which keeps their real email private.
- **No advertising tracking without consent**: our authentication flow is used only for account access and does not collect app interactions for advertising purposes without the user’s consent.

You can find the option on the login screen as **“Continuar con Apple”**.

Thank you.
